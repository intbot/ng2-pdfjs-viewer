## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0+
- Angular CLI 20.0+
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer.git
cd ng2-pdfjs-viewer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install SampleApp dependencies
cd SampleApp
npm install
cd ..
```

### Getting the App Working

**Important**: Due to Angular's build cache, you may need to clear the cache before running the app:

```bash
# Clear Angular cache (Windows PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "SampleApp\.angular"

# Or manually delete the .angular folder in SampleApp directory
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build the library
npm run build

# Run the sample app
npm run start

# Run the complete test workflow (build → publish → update → install → run)
./test.bat

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Testing Workflow

The project uses a comprehensive test workflow via `test.bat`:

1. **Build** the library
2. **Publish** to local npm registry
3. **Update** dependencies in SampleApp
4. **Install** updated dependencies
5. **Run** the SampleApp

This ensures you're testing the actual built library, not just the source code.

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📝 Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Angular style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow Angular template best practices
- Use Angular Material components when possible

### CSS/SCSS

- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Use responsive design principles
- Avoid `!important` unless necessary

### Git

- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages

### Key Components

- **ng2-pdfjs-viewer.component.ts**: Main Angular component
- **postmessage-wrapper.js**: PDF.js integration layer
- **ActionQueueManager.ts**: Action dispatching system
- **PropertyTransformers.ts**: Data transformation utilities

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test all public methods and properties
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

### Integration Tests

- Test component integration with PDF.js
- Test event handling and communication
- Test different PDF sources (URL, Blob, Uint8Array)

### E2E Tests

- Test complete user workflows
- Test on different browsers
- Test responsive behavior

## 📚 Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document complex algorithms and logic

### README Updates

- Update feature lists when adding new features
- Add usage examples for new functionality
- Update installation and setup instructions

### API Documentation

- Document all input properties
- Document all output events
- Document all public methods
- Include type information

## 🚀 Release Process

### Version Bumping

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update version in `lib/package.json`
- Update CHANGELOG.md with new features
- Create git tag for release

### Publishing

Publishing is **automated**: pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/main.yml`,
which builds `lib/` and publishes to npm using **trusted publishing (OIDC)** with a
**provenance attestation** — no long-lived npm token is stored in the repo.

```bash
# Cut a release (from lib/) — builds, commits, tags, and pushes the tag
cd lib
npm version patch   # or minor / major
```

For a local dry run you can still `npm run build && npm run package` in `lib/` to produce
the tarball without publishing.

#### One-time setup: npm trusted publisher (maintainer only)

Before the OIDC publish works, the `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` package must trust this repo's workflow:

1. On npmjs.com → the `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` package → **Settings → Trusted Publisher**.
2. Add a **GitHub Actions** publisher: organization `intbot`, repository `ng2-pdfjs-viewer`,
   workflow filename `main.yml`.
3. Once configured, the legacy `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret can be deleted.

Provenance is generated automatically because this is a public repository.

### Repository security & Dependabot

This repo ships only the `lib/` package — it has **zero runtime dependencies**. The playground and
demo apps (`playground/`, `SampleApp/`, `sample-app-material/`) and the docs site (`docs-website/`)
are **not published**.

To keep the repository's security signal honest, Dependabot **alerts** for those non-shipped
projects are auto-dismissed by a repository-level **auto-triage rule** that matches their manifest
paths. This is configured once in **Settings → Code security → Dependabot → Auto-triage rules**
(action: auto-dismiss; manifest path: `playground/**`, `SampleApp/**`, `sample-app-material/**`, `docs-website/**`);
the built-in "dismiss low-impact dev-scoped" preset is also enabled. Dependabot **version-update**
PRs are scoped to `/lib` and the GitHub Actions workflows via `.github/dependabot.yml`. See
`SECURITY.md` for the rationale.

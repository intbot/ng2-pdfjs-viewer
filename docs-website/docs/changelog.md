# What's New 🎉

## Latest Release Highlights

The latest release upgrades the engine and turns the viewer into a full editing surface:

- **PDF.js 6.x** bundled (from the 5.x line) — all component APIs work unchanged. Note: the PDF.js 6 modern build raises the browser floor; Safari is only supported by PDF.js's legacy build, which this package does not ship
- **Angular 22 verified** — library built on ng-packagr 22 / TypeScript 6; peer dependencies stay wide (`>=10`, links on Angular 14+)
- **Annotation editing & eSign**: highlight, text, draw, stamp + opt-in signature and comment editors; persistence via [`getAnnotations()` / `setAnnotations()`](./features/annotation-editing) and download-with-edits (`getDocumentAsBlob()`)
- **[Forms](./features/forms)**: `[(formData)]` two-way binding, programmatic field access
- **[Programmatic search](./features/search)**, **[page organization](./features/page-organization)**, **[read aloud](./features/read-aloud)** with sentence highlighting
- **[AI assistant](./features/ai-assistant)** — bring-your-own OpenAI-compatible endpoint with clickable page citations; the library never calls any AI service on its own
- **[Custom toolbar, sidebar & page overlays](./features/custom-ui)**, **[content protection](./features/content-protection)** with watermarks, **[authenticated loading](./features/loading-documents)**, true dark page rendering, and four new viewer events (`onSidebarViewChanged`, `onLayersChanged`, `onNamedAction`, `onDocumentProperties`)

Behavior changes to review when upgrading: `showAnnotations` now defaults to `true`; external PDF links open in a new tab by default (`externalLinkTarget`, with `allow-popups` added to the iframe sandbox); `zoomChange` emits named presets (`page-fit`, `page-width`, `auto`) instead of raw numbers for preset zooms.

:::

## 🚀 Complete Rewrite

### Why a Rewrite?
After 8 years of evolution, we decided to rebuild ng2-pdfjs-viewer from scratch to:
- Adopt modern Angular patterns and best practices
- Improve performance with event-driven architecture
- Enhance security with template-based UI
- Provide better TypeScript support
- Ensure long-term maintainability

### Architecture Improvements
- **Event-Driven**: Pure event-based system with universal action dispatcher
- **Trust-Based**: Eliminated defensive programming patterns
- **Single File Integration**: All customizations in one file for easy PDF.js upgrades
- **Readiness Hierarchy**: 5-level readiness system for reliable action execution

## ✨ New Features

### Template-Based UI
Replace HTML strings with Angular templates for better security and maintainability:

```html
<ng-template #loadingTemplate>
  <div class="custom-loader">
    <mat-spinner></mat-spinner>
    <p>Loading your document...</p>
  </div>
</ng-template>

<ng2-pdfjs-viewer [customSpinnerTpl]="loadingTemplate">
</ng2-pdfjs-viewer>
```

### Advanced Theme System
Complete visual customization through CSS custom properties:

```typescript
themeConfig = {
  theme: 'dark',
  primaryColor: '#3f51b5',
  backgroundColor: '#1e1e1e',
  textColor: '#ffffff'
};
```

### Convenience Configuration
Object-based configuration for cleaner code:

```typescript
groupVisibility = {
  "download": true,
  "print": true,
  "find": true,
  "fullScreen": true,
  "openFile": true,
  "viewBookmark": true,
  "annotations": false
};
```

### Enhanced Event System
24+ events covering all user interactions:
- `onDocumentLoad` - Document loaded successfully
- `onDocumentError` - Document failed to load
- `onPageChange` - Page navigation
- `onZoomChange` - Zoom level changed
- `onRotationChange` - Document rotated
- `onProgress` - Loading progress
- And many more...

### Mobile-First Design

- Responsive layout
- Adaptive toolbar
- Mobile navigation patterns
